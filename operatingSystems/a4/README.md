# Requirements

A program that takes a reference string and the number of frames as inputs to simulate page replacement algorithms. Suppose the maximum length of a reference string is 20 and there are 5 differnt numbers of pages. Randomly generates a reference string, e.g. 2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ... Takes the number of frames as an input from the user. Finds out the different number of page faults using the Optimal and LRU algorithms. If there is a tie, uses the FIFO algorithm to break the tie. Prints out the page replacement process and you can see how LRU differs from the optimal.

## How to run the files!
```
1.) First unzip the folder and navigate into the Assignment - 4 folder.
2.) Once you are inside the Assignment - 4 folder you can begin compiling the assignment files.
3.) Now you will need to open a terminal in this directory. You can do this by following these instructions:
* Windows 10 hold shift + right click you will see "open powershell window here" click that.
*	Mac right click the Assignment 2 folder and navigate to Services. Here you should see "New Terminal at Folder"
*	Linux Distros simply right click the Assignment -2 folder and click "Open in Terminal"
4.)Once the terminal is open you can start compiling the files. To do so following the instructions below.
To compile the files you can simply copy and paste the commands below:
•	Assignment lab4.c
gcc lab4.c
To run the executable file that pre.c created input ./a.out in the terminal:
./a.out
You will then be prompt to enter a number of frames.
```
