# Requirements

A program that takes a reference string and the number of frames as inputs to simulate page replacement algorithms. Suppose the maximum length of a reference string is 20 and there are 5 differnt numbers of pages. Randomly generates a reference string, e.g. 2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ... Takes the number of frames as an input from the user. Finds out the different number of page faults using the Optimal and LRU algorithms. If there is a tie, uses the FIFO algorithm to break the tie. Prints out the page replacement process and you can see how LRU differs from the optimal.

## How to run the files!
```
1.) First unzip the folder and navigate into the Assignment - 4 folder.
2.) Once you are inside the Assignment - 4 folder you can begin compiling the assignment files.
3.) Now you will need to open a terminal in this directory. You can do this by following these instructions:
• Windows 10 hold shift + right click you will see "open powershell window here" click that.
•	Mac right click the Assignment 2 folder and navigate to Services. Here you should see "New Terminal at Folder"
•	Linux Distros simply right click the Assignment -2 folder and click "Open in Terminal"
4.)Once the terminal is open you can start compiling the files. To do so following the instructions below.
```
### To compile the files you can simply copy and paste the commands below:
```
•	Assignment lab4.c
gcc lab4.c
To run the executable file that pre.c created input ./a.out in the terminal:
./a.out
You will then be prompt to enter a number of frames.
```
